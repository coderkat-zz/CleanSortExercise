# CleanSortExercise
A python program that cleans an input string of non-letter, non-digit characters and then sorts.

The challenge at hand is to sort a list of integers and strings.
* This program takes a list of strings (from a .txt file) containing integers and
words and returns a sorted version of the list.
* Input given may contain non-letter, non-digit characters. Remove any such characters
before sorting.
* All words must be in alphabetical order, all integerss sorted numberically.
* This keeps element types in the same order (i.e. if the nth element is an
int, the final nth element must also be an int.)
* Program prints cleaned/sorted list to a new text file
